<ul>
<li><strong>Modified (in-school) Quarantine: </strong>This option may only be used by student close contacts exposed in a setting supervised by school staff, when the COVID-19- positive person and student close contact were both wearing masks during all contacts with each other within 6 feet. To remain in school the student must test within 24 hours of notification, and on or after day 5. Rapid result (antigen) testing is recommended. The student may continue to participate in expanded learning or child care programs offered on the school campus but must quarantine at home from all other before-school, after-school, and weekend activities. Activities may resume on or after Day 6 with evidence of a negative test sample collected on or after Day 5. (See <a href="https://covid-19.sdcoe.net/Health-Practices/Guidelines-for-Schools#faq">FAQ</a> answer No. 7).</li>
<li><strong>Return on Day 6:&nbsp;</strong>It is recommended that the student close contact test ASAP. Return as early as Day 6 is authorized with evidence that a diagnostic specimen collected on or after Day 5 is negative. For household exposures, see the note below.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Day 11:&nbsp;</strong>Allows a student to return on Day 11. Testing is recommended on Day 5, 6, or 7, but not required. For household exposures, see the note below.</li>
<li><strong>Household Exposures:</strong> A person who lives with someone who is COVID-positive must quarantine until their last contact with the positive household member(s) while they are contagious. In most cases, this will be until the day the last COVID-positive household member is no longer required to isolate. Counting from this date, return is possible using the Day 6 or Day 11 options described above. See questions 6 and 7 of the <a href="https://covid-19.sdcoe.net/Health-Practices/Guidelines-for-Schools#faq" target="_blank">Decision Tree FAQs</a> for more information and for instructions on how to isolate a positive individual in a room away from others in the home.</li>
<li><strong>If symptoms develop or a positive test result occurs</strong>&nbsp;during quarantine, require isolation at home and consult the Symptom and Isolation or Asymptomatic Positive tree.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal; background: #DEEAF6;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Tahoma',sans-serif; color: #1c3857;">Additional Requirements for Return Before Day 11<br /></span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Students must agree to self-monitor for symptoms, wear a face covering over their nose and mouth as required, use good hand hygiene practices, and use good cough and sneeze etiquette.</li>
<li>Accommodations (like changes in the close contact&rsquo;s work, room, seat, or bus assignments) should be made to ensure that close contacts returning before Day 11 will not be near others who are immunocompromised (i.e, solid organ or bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy, similarly reduced ability to fight infections). If these accommodations cannot be made the close contact must quarantine for 10 days.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="MsoNormal">The number of days required for quarantine is counted from the day after the person&rsquo;s last close contact with a person who is contagious with COVID-19. Please see <a href="https://covid-19.sdcoe.net/Health-Practices/Guidelines-for-Schools#faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> No. 1 under &ldquo;isolation&rdquo; for information on how long people are considered to be contagious.</li>
